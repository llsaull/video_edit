## About

This is a simple script to wrap ffmpeg calls to edit videos. I wrote this to
prepare lecture for my classes, since the process of running ffmpeg from the command
line is tedious. It involves remembering long command arguments and
knowing the name of your files.

## How to run:

Run the script from the folder where you videos are located.
