## About

This is a simple script to wrap ffmpeg calls to edit videos. I wrote this to
prepare lecture for my classes, since the process of running ffmpeg from the command
line is tedious. It involves remembering long command arguments and
knowing the name of your files.

Currenlty this is what it does:
```
   Choose an option:        
         c - cut a video   
         j - join videos   
         t - add text to video
```

## How to run:

Run the script from the folder where you videos are located.
